## Covid-19 Modal

This plugin provides an easy to install and configure modal functionality. It is intended to give site maintainers a quick way to convey critical information during the current pandemic.

## The plugin provides:

 - A single modal with a settings page for customizing the title, body content, and call to action link url and text of the modal.
 - Modal is dismissable and sets a javascript cookie to remember the user's action for future visits. 
 - CSS and Javascript is enqueued using WordPress's hooks.
 - Modal content is fed to the pure JS modal implementation via WordPress REST calls.
 - Modal content can be overridden using the `covid_modal_template` filter.
 - Stylesheets can be added/removed from enqueue via the `covid_modal_stylesheet` filter.
 - All modal assets can be enabled/disabled by checking/unchecking the Enable Modal box on the settings page.

## Overriding the Modal Content

To override the modal content inside your theme's functions file hook into the `covid_modal_template` filter.

```
<?php
function covid_modal_template_override($modal_content, $modal_data) {
    // $modal_content is the rendered markup from wp-content/plugins/covid-modal/templates/modal_template.php
    // using the same $modal_data provided to this hook.
    //
    // $modal_data = [
    //     'modal_title' => get_option('modal_title'),
    //     'modal_content' => get_option('modal_content'),
    //     'cta_link_url' => get_option('cta_link_url'),
    //     'cta_link_text' => get_option('cta_link_text')
    // ];

    return $modal_content;
}
add_filter('covid_modal_template', 'covid_modal_template_override');
```

## Overriding Modal Styles

Our styles provide a baseline that works with most sites and tries to preserve existing site styles and not be too opinionated. It may require additional styles be added.

```
function covid_modal_stylesheet_override($stylesheets) {
    // remove built-in stylesheets
    // $stylesheets = [];

    // Add a stylesheet to include after the default styles
    // $stylesheets[] = 'path/to/my/stylesheet/modal-override.css';

    return $stylesheets;
}
add_filter('covid_modal_stylesheet', 'covid_modal_stylesheet_override');
```

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who is this for? =

This plugin is for site maintainers and developers. While the plugin is fully featured, we built it for ourselves and our clients. We needed a plugin that worked out-of-box on install but also allowed extreme customization. It was on this last point that existing plugins didn't fit our needs.

= How do I configure the modal content? =

Within the WordPress admin site, go to: `Settings > Covid Modal` to fill out and submit the settings page.

= I installed and configured my modal but it looks bad with my theme, what can I do to fix it? =

We tried hard to scope our styles and class structure in such a way as to not conflict with custom themes however we cannot 100% avoid style collisions. If the site styles and the modal styles conflict, you may need to add additional styles or override provided styles to customize to your specific WordPress site.

= How is this different from <insert some plugin name here>?

There are many alert, banner, modal, etc plugins available. This one is simple yet full featured and implements custom WordPress filter hooks to allow for extreme customization.
